## 1.10.7

More Threat Intelligence improvements - the threat dashboard now identifies services by name for 60+ commonly targeted ports, and correctly handles portless protocols like ICMP and GRE. See [v1.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/NetworkOptimizer/releases/tag/v1.10.0) for what's new in v1.10.0+

## Threat Intelligence

- **Service names for targeted ports** - The threat dashboard now shows service names (SSH, RDP, MSSQL, Docker API, Proxmox, etc.) for 60+ commonly targeted ports instead of just port numbers. When we get a generic service name, it falls back to the built-in port lookup for a more useful label.
- **ICMP and GRE protocol handling** - Portless protocols like ICMP and GRE previously showed as "Port 0" and were lumped together. They now display the protocol name and get separate rows in the targeted ports table.
- **Proper service name casing** - Service names like MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL now display with correct casing instead of all-lowercase.

## Fixes

- **Threat dashboard mobile overflow** - Fixed horizontal scrolling on mobile viewports in the threat dashboard.

## Installation

**Windows**: Download the MSI installer below

**Docker**:
```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

**macOS** (native, recommended for accurate speed tests vs Docker Desktop):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/NetworkOptimizer.git && cd NetworkOptimizer && ./scripts/install-macos-native.sh
# or if you already have it cloned
cd NetworkOptimizer && git pull && ./scripts/install-macos-native.sh
```

**Proxmox**:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozark-Connect/NetworkOptimizer/main/scripts/proxmox/install.sh)"
```

For other platforms (Synology, QNAP, Unraid, native Linux), see the [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/NetworkOptimizer/blob/main/docker/DEPLOYMENT.md).
