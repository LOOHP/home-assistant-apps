## Addons
### Network Optimizer for UniFi
Host the [Network Optimizer for UniFi](https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/NetworkOptimizer) as two Home Assistant Addons.<br>
**For the initial password, check the addon's log tab instead of using the command.**
<br><br>
### TimeTree ICS Host
Periodically export and host your Timetree Calendar. Exporting is done using [TimeTree-Exporter](https://github.com/eoleedi/TimeTree-Exporter).<br>
After that, you can use the [Remote Calendar Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/remote_calendar/) to link to it, or do whatever you want with it.
