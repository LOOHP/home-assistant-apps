# TimeTree ICS Host

Periodically export and host your Timetree Calendar. Exporting is done using [TimeTree-Exporter](https://github.com/eoleedi/TimeTree-Exporter).<br>
After that, you can use the [Remote Calendar Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/remote_calendar/) to link to it, or do whatever you want with it.
